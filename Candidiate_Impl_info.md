# Audition API Implementation Summary

This is a spring boot application in Java 17 which focus on API integration (to talk to 3rd party tools). 

Below is a short summary of what my understanding is based on brief exposure. 
There are few enhancements that can be done are 
* Swagger can be added for API documentation generation, providing an interactive interface for developers to explore and test the API endpoints.
* CI/CD Pipelines - CI/CD makes sure all unit tets are passing and application state is green and the app can be deployed to staging/prod environments.
* Monitoring tools - If the app is deployed in AWS, cloudwatch can be used for logging and monitoring. 
* Lambda/API gateway - the app is a standalone app in spring boot and canbe deployed to either ECS or EKS in AWS but it can also be exposed as microservices using lambda and api gateway

- **Project Structure:** 
  - Organized using Gradle standard structure with packages for controllers, models, services, and API integrations.

- **Code Documentation:** 
  - Utilizes Javadoc comments for methods and classes to enhance readability.

- **Dependency Management:** 
  - Managed via Gradle with semantic versioning for dependencies.

- **Testing Strategy:** 
  - Comprehensive unit tests with JUnit, Mockito, and JaCoCo for test coverage.

- **Error Handling:** 
  - Implements custom exceptions and global exception handlers for centralized error processing.
